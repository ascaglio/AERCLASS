# AERCLASS

**Aerosol Classification and Uncertainty Analysis Toolkit**

AERCLASS is an open-source Python package designed to apply a suite of 2D aerosol classification methods and estimate their associated uncertainties. It is built with a focus on atmospheric science research and reproducibility.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Implements 7 published aerosol classification schemes
- Propagates measurement uncertainties to classification outputs
- Calculates misclassification rates based on uncertainty bounds
- Includes plotting utilities for 2D distribution and error visualization
- Modular, extensible, and easy to use with AERONET and other sources

---

## ðŸ“¥ Installation

You can install AERCLASS locally with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Run the complete classification workflow with:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or try a minimal example with just Method I:

```bash
python example.py
```
